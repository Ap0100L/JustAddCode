# Alternative Dark Editor Themes for Delphi 10.2.2

Here you will find some alternative editor color schemes, as presented in our blog post "[Alternative Dark Editor Themes for Delphi 10.2.2](https://blog.grijjy.com/2017/12/29/alternative-dark-editor-themes-for-delphi-10-2-2/)".

To install a theme:

- Shut down the Delphi IDE.
- Run `migrationtool.exe`, which you can find in the `c:\Program Files (x86)\Embarcadero\Studio\19.0\bin\` directory of your Delphi installation.
- Choose the option "Import settings from a migration file" and browse for one of the theme files (with an `.idesettings` extension) .
- On the next page, accept the defaults (to import all settings).
- On the page after that, select the IDE version you want to import the settings into. You should *only* select version 10.2 (with update 2) or later, since the theme isn't designed for earlier Delphi versions.
- Finish the wizard.
